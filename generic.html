								<h3>Kaleb Key</h3>
								<p>I am a recent graduate of Kennesaw State University with a Bachelor of Science in computer engineering. In my undergraduate career I have traversed the engineering spectrum and used what I have learned in leadership positions and across an engineering internship. In the local community I actively participated in serveral organizations, however my primary focus was my undergraduate university's chapter of IEEE. There I served as the Hardware lead for the competition team for two years, where I organized the team structure as well as guided the design process of the robots for competition (circuitry,physical models, and mechanics). I also served as the secretary of the same organization for one year. </p>

								<p>My experience is primarily in the realm of embedded programming, working with embedded devices and creating drivers for sensors and actuators. I have done this in professional settings, coursework and in extracurricular settings. However I have a wide purview of lesser experiences in areas such as: electronic design, object oriented programming, robotics, & FPGA deisgn. I am also continuing to learn and work with technologies such as Machine Learning and Computer Vision. In doing this I will be beginning a Master of Science program in Intelligent Robotic Systems (M.s Robotics).</p>
